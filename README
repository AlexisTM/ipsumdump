ACIRI-IPSUMDUMP
===============
    This program reads IP packets from the network (using libpcap, or
packet sockets on Linux) or from a tcpdump(1) save file, and writes an
ASCII summary of the packet data to the standard output. Comments on the
first couple lines describe the summary's contents; for example:

!creator "aciri-ipsumdump -i wvlan0"
!host no.lcdf.org
!starttime 996022410.322317 (Tue Jul 24 17:53:30 2001)
!data 'ip src' 'ip dst'
63.250.213.167 192.150.187.106
63.250.213.167 192.150.187.106
// ...

    The `aciri-ipsumdump' program is built in the `src' directory, so run
it from there, or give an appropriate `--prefix' option to `./configure'
and run `make install'. Run `aciri-ipsumdump --help' to see what options
are available.

INSTALLATION
------------
    Usual Autoconf standard: `./configure', with any of the usual options,
followed by `make' or `make install'.

ABOUT CLICK
-----------
    This program is built on the Click modular router, an extensible system
for processing packets. Click routers are built from C++ components called
elements. While some elements run only in a Linux kernel, most can run
either in the kernel or in user space, and there are user-level elements
for reading packets from pcap or tcpdump files.

    The aciri-ipsumdump program just builds up a simple Click configuration
and runs it, as if by the `click' user-level driver. However, you don't
need to install Click to run aciri-ipsumdump; the `libclick' directory
contains all the relevant parts of Click, bundled into a library.

    If you're curious, try running `aciri-ipsumdump --config' with some
other options to see the Click configuration aciri-ipsumdump would run.
Only three source files had to be written from scratch:
src/aciri-ipsumdump.cc, src/toipsumdump.cc, and src/toipsumdump.hh. The
rest came from Click itself.

    This is, I think, a pleasant way to write a packet processor!
