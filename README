IPSUMDUMP
=========

    This program reads IP packets from the network (using libpcap, or
packet sockets on Linux), or from a tcpdump(1) save file, and writes an
ASCII summary of the packet data to the standard output. Comments on the
first couple lines describe the summary's contents; for example:

!IPSummaryDump 1.2
!creator "ipsumdump -i wvlan0"
!host no.lcdf.org
!runtime 996022410.322317 (Tue Jul 24 17:53:30 2001)
!data ip_src ip_dst
63.250.213.167 192.150.187.106
63.250.213.167 192.150.187.106
// ...

    `ipsumdump' builds in the `src' directory, so run it from there, or
give an appropriate `--prefix' option to `./configure' and run `make
install'. Run `ipsumdump --help' to see what options are available.

INSTALLATION
------------

    Standard Autoconf: `./configure', with any of the usual options,
followed by `make' or `make install'.  If you checked out ipsumdump from
a git repository, see README.git.

ABOUT CLICK
-----------

    `ipsumdump' is built from the Click modular router, an extensible
system for processing packets. Click routers consist of C++ components
called elements. While some elements run only in a Linux kernel, most can
run either in the kernel or in user space, and there are user-level
elements for reading packets from libpcap or from tcpdump files.

    The `ipsumdump' program just builds up a simple Click configuration and
runs it, as if by the `click' user-level driver. However, you don't need to
install Click to run ipsumdump; the `libclick' directory contains all the
relevant parts of Click, bundled into a library.

    If you're curious, try running `ipsumdump --config' with some other
options to see the Click configuration ipsumdump would run. Only three
source files had to be written from scratch: src/ipsumdump.cc,
src/toipsumdump.cc, and src/toipsumdump.hh. The rest came from Click
itself.

    This is, I think, a pleasant way to write a packet processor!
