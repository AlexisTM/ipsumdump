Ipsumdump NEWS

Version 1.18   30.Dec.2001

* Fix bug with --payload: ipsumdump could output a payload string
  containing too much or too little data. Reported by Vern.


Version 1.17   17.Dec.2001

* Reading from network interfaces was broken by version 1.14: unless -w was
  given, ToIPSummaryDump treated partially-read packets (low SNAPLEN) as
  erroneous. Reported by Brecht Vermeulen <brecht.vermeulen@rug.ac.be>.


Version 1.16   30.Nov.2001

* Progress bar improvements: The progress bar will not appear if normal
  output is to the terminal, or if the invocation doesn't take very long.


Version 1.15   28.Nov.2001

* --length, --payload-length, and --payload deal with IP length, ignoring
  any link-level padding at the end. Problem reported by Vern.


Version 1.14   28.Nov.2001

* Don't generate mistaken output for bad IP, TCP, or UDP headers (print
  dashes instead). Bad headers include IP versions other than 4, bad IP
  header lengths, bad TCP header lengths, and TCP/UDP headers not included
  in a single fragment. Suggested by Vern.

* Add --bad-packets option. When supplied, the IP summary dump contains
  messages like `!bad IP header length 2' on packets with bad IP, TCP, or
  UDP headers, instead of normal output (with dashes).

* Add --payload option.


Version 1.13   4.Nov.2001

* Speed improvements in --tu-summary/--ipsumdump.


Version 1.12   31.Oct.2001

* Remove default dump content options. If you don't supply any dump
  contents, ipsumdump won't create a summary dump. It still will create any
  --write-tcpdump file, though. For Vern.

* Catch fewer signals.


Version 1.11   29.Oct.2001

* Add progress bar.


Version 1.10   10.Oct.2001

* Add --fragment and --fragoff options. Fix behavior with fragments.
  Reported by Vern Paxson <vern@icir.org>.


Version 1.9   10.Oct.2001

* Add --record-counts option.


Version 1.8   9.Oct.2001

* Fix --filter option, and add --no-promisc.


Version 1.7   9.Oct.2001

* Bug fixes. Signal handling. Sampling works correctly with MULTIPACKET.


Version 1.6   9.Oct.2001

* The --write-tcpdump output file includes link-level headers.


Version 1.5   8.Oct.2001

* Add --random-seed option.


Version 1.4   7.Oct.2001

* Add --sample and --collate options.


Version 1.3

* Add FromDevice.kernel_drops handler, and use that handler to report any
  kernel packet drops.
