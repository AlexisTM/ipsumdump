Ipsumdump NEWS

Version 1.24   31.Jul.2002

* Speed up interaction of `-r' (read from tcpdump(1) files) and `-A'
  (anonymize). Previously this would uselessly copy 4MB of data per packet!
  Reported by Vern.

* Add `--limit-packets' option.


Version 1.23   2.Jun.2002

* Documentation updates.

* TCP flag bits 6 and 7 are printed as E and W, for ECE and CWR, based on
  the ECN Proposed Standard.

* Fixed bug with interaction between `--interval' and `--interface'.

* Under `--tcpdump', truncated IP packets are now printed as normal
  packets. Some tcpdump files don't correctly record the caplen.


Version 1.22   2.Jun.2002

* Fragment offset fields, produced by -G, formerly were expressed in 8-byte
  units. Starting with this version, fragment offset fields are expressed
  in bytes. Updated the `!IPSummaryDump' file version number to `1.1' to
  represent this change.

* Fixed bug with reading ipsumdump files: incorrect IP lengths caused many
  packets to be ignored.

* Update to Click-1.2.4.


Version 1.21   26.Mar.2002

* Update endianness test (Click failed to compile on Solaris). Reported by
  Ahmed Aslam <aaslam@csee.usf.edu>.


Version 1.20   8.Jan.2002

* Add `--interval' option.


Version 1.19   31.Dec.2001

* Add some sanity checks on ip_len to the TCP and UDP header checks, and
  improve payload length calculation. Reported by Vern.


Version 1.18   30.Dec.2001

* Fix bug with --payload: ipsumdump could output a payload string
  containing too much or too little data. Reported by Vern.


Version 1.17   17.Dec.2001

* Reading from network interfaces was broken by version 1.14: unless -w was
  given, ToIPSummaryDump treated partially-read packets (low SNAPLEN) as
  erroneous. Reported by Brecht Vermeulen <brecht.vermeulen@rug.ac.be>.


Version 1.16   30.Nov.2001

* Progress bar improvements: The progress bar will not appear if normal
  output is to the terminal, or if the invocation doesn't take very long.


Version 1.15   28.Nov.2001

* --length, --payload-length, and --payload deal with IP length, ignoring
  any link-level padding at the end. Problem reported by Vern.


Version 1.14   28.Nov.2001

* Don't generate mistaken output for bad IP, TCP, or UDP headers (print
  dashes instead). Bad headers include IP versions other than 4, bad IP
  header lengths, bad TCP header lengths, and TCP/UDP headers not included
  in a single fragment. Suggested by Vern.

* Add --bad-packets option. When supplied, the IP summary dump contains
  messages like `!bad IP header length 2' on packets with bad IP, TCP, or
  UDP headers, instead of normal output (with dashes).

* Add --payload option.


Version 1.13   4.Nov.2001

* Speed improvements in --tu-summary/--ipsumdump.


Version 1.12   31.Oct.2001

* Remove default dump content options. If you don't supply any dump
  contents, ipsumdump won't create a summary dump. It still will create any
  --write-tcpdump file, though. For Vern.

* Catch fewer signals.


Version 1.11   29.Oct.2001

* Add progress bar.


Version 1.10   10.Oct.2001

* Add --fragment and --fragoff options. Fix behavior with fragments.
  Reported by Vern Paxson <vern@icir.org>.


Version 1.9   10.Oct.2001

* Add --record-counts option.


Version 1.8   9.Oct.2001

* Fix --filter option, and add --no-promisc.


Version 1.7   9.Oct.2001

* Bug fixes. Signal handling. Sampling works correctly with MULTIPACKET.


Version 1.6   9.Oct.2001

* The --write-tcpdump output file includes link-level headers.


Version 1.5   8.Oct.2001

* Add --random-seed option.


Version 1.4   7.Oct.2001

* Add --sample and --collate options.


Version 1.3

* Add FromDevice.kernel_drops handler, and use that handler to report any
  kernel packet drops.
