BUILDING IPSUMDUMP FROM GIT SOURCES
===================================

   Check out Click from git and build it.  Change back to the ipsumdump
source directory and run "./sourcecheckout.sh CLICKBUILDDIR", where
CLICKBUILDDIR is the Click build directory.  Then configure and build as
usual.  You may want to supply the "--with-click-build=CLICKBUILDDIR"
option.
